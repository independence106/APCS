time spent: 

ACTIVITY 1
1) 
    a) public static double sentimentVal( String word )
    b) Yes, this method requires you to input a String. If you pass a different type of parameter, it returns 0. 
    c) Yes the method returns a value. The return type is "double"

2) 
    METHOD CALL | RETURN value
    abandoned     -0.09
    corner        -0.06
    Timmy          0

3) 
    a) Yes, this statement would compile because the parameter is a string and there are no other errors.
    b) No, this statement would not compile because the paramater passed, 0.5, is a double and not a String. 
    c) No, this statement would not compile because sentimentVal only takes one parameter. This statement passes two.

ACTIVITY 2
4) In short, our totalSentiment method relies on the String methods substring and indexOf to find the sentimentValue of each individual word in the review. Using a while loop with the condition that there is a space separating words (" "), we find the index of the space and then find the sentiment value of the substring that ends at that space. For the first iteration, our starting value would be 0. So the first word would be from 0 to the index of the first space. Afterwards, we would make our starting value equal to the index of the first found space. This way we can avoid finding the index of the same space. We continuing iterating until indexOf returns -1, which means that there are no more spaces. We know that we can terminate the iteration here because no more spaces indicate that there are no more available words.

5) 
    a) Yes, our ratings make sense. For example, the starRating for our simple review, which was mostly negative, returned 1. When we tested it with another review which was extremely positive, starRating returned 4 which is the highest rating you can acheive.
    b) One thing we could do to improve our starRating method is to take into account the length of the review. Longer reviews tend to have an advantage because the totalSentiment is naturally higher/lower. This means that even in reviews that are mostly positive, they still might only return 2 or 3 because they are short and concise. Just because a review doesn't have much to say doesn't mean that the star rating should be lower. We could also add another rating level. Currently it only goes from 0 to 4. 

6) 
    a) The logical error here is located in his conditional statements. For instance, the method starts with if(totalSentiment < 15). This means that if the totalSentiment is any greater than 15, instead of returning the highest possible rating, starRating might return something lower. This trend can be found throughout the entire code. In short, if the totalSentiment value was 20 (which is extremely positive), then starRating would return 0 because 20 is not less than 15 or 0. 
    b) He can fix his code by simply changing < to >. If total sentiment is greater than 15, then you get the highest rating. If not, then you check if it meets the conditions of the next rating and so on so forth. This way you can avoid assigning a rating that misrepresents the review.

ACTIVITY 3

3) The indexOf method finds the index of the string where the desired character is first located. The substring method returns a string from desired indexes. These two can be combined to divide
   a string into two parts by finding a certain index of a character and then using the substring method to split the String into two parts.  We need to add 1 to the position of the space when copying
   the remainder of the string because if we are given the string "there" and we want to split it into two strings("th" and "ere"), you would copy the string from index 0 to the string at 1. If you copy the rest
   starting from index 2 to index 4 you only get " ther". 

4) In review.java

5) static methods means that you can call them without instantiating the class.

6) We can modify it by replacing getRandomAdjective with getBadAdjective or getGoodAdjective.

ACTIVITY 4

1) One reason would be if you wanted to demote an opposing company's product by generating a lot of negative reviews and thus making it so less people are likely to buy the product.

2) The opposite of 1

3) To create a stronger review, we need it so that our adjectives are consistent with each other (ie, using positive adjectives only or negative adjectives only). The algorithm will take the review
   and create a star rating. If the star rating is positive then use only positive adjectives and vice versa for negatives.

5) Nothing. It would return oneWord without the first letter. (Pine) -> (ine)

6) Otherwise you would not be able to find it in the hashmap

7) you could optimize it to return very very high value positive words

ACTIVITY 5

1) I thought it would be kinda cool if I could order the length of the words that I use
2) Umm, I did it incrementally, I also planned it out a KTS
3) I think I alr did that
4) Its pretty self explanatory, see Activity5.java
5) for (int i = 0; i < order.length; i++) {
            if (ascending) {
                returns += map.get(order[i]) + " ";
            } else {
                returns += map.get(order[order.length - i - 1]) + " ";
            }
            
        }
6) for (int i = 0; i < brokenUp.size(); i++) {
            map.put(brokenUp.get(i).length(), brokenUp.get(i));
        }
    Iterates through and assigns values to keys
